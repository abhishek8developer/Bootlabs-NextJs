                    <p>We build custom platforms and frameworks based on the business use cases and aligned to your needs of availability, resilience and budget.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Our Thoughts: </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p># A well architected source control system integrated to continuous integrations system with a pipeline build with security gates to help deploy artifacts with consistency</p>
                    <p># Since we know every application and set of users will have different needs thus we ensure the horizontal compliance and governance is always in place, while individual application, product or team can independently build on their vertical software stack.</p>
                    <p># These platforms are mostly self-service thus enabling both the organization and teams align it to best suite their needs and still give the granular visibility of architecture, cost and utility, they can  custom build their own CI/CD, deployment flows, notifications and audit mechanism beyond the default availability.</p>
                    <p># Also, through these platforms we build a standardization and learning curve for best practices and safe ecosystem for any infrastructure , aligned to the culture of the organization. While reducing the dependencies of checkpoints, building security as integral component of code.</p>
